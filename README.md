To create an automated solution in Make (formerly Integromat) for handling content creation, research, SEO optimization, and WordPress publishing, you can break down the process into several key modules and use APIs or external services for each task. Below, I'll guide you on how to approach this using Python and Make (Integromat).
Key Components and Process Flow

    Trending Industry Research: Use a web scraping service, an API (e.g., Google Trends, BuzzSumo), or news APIs to gather trending topics daily.
    Content Creation: Integrate GPT-based APIs (e.g., OpenAI GPT-3) to generate detailed blog posts with proper citations and references.
    SEO Optimization & Linking: Use a tool or service to track and suggest internal/external links (e.g., Moz, Ahrefs) and optimize for SEO.
    Publishing to WordPress: Use the WordPress API or a WordPress integration in Make/Integromat to automatically publish the content.
    Image Selection & Optimization: Integrate with an image source (like Unsplash API) to fetch appropriate images and optimize them for SEO.
    SEO Tracking: Track the performance of the keywords using Google Analytics, Moz, or similar services.

Step 1: Trend Research & Content Generation

You can use Python and APIs for this task, and then trigger Make/Integromat to automate each process.

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import openai
import json

# Initialize OpenAI API (replace with your API key)
openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'

# Example function to fetch trending topics from Google Trends or similar service
def fetch_trending_topics():
    # Example of fetching trends from an API (e.g., Google Trends or BuzzSumo)
    # For the sake of demonstration, we will use a dummy list of trends.
    trending_topics = [
        "AI in Healthcare",
        "Sustainable Energy Solutions",
        "Quantum Computing Developments"
    ]
    return trending_topics

# Function to generate a detailed blog post with citations using OpenAI GPT-3
def generate_blog_post(topic):
    prompt = f"Write a detailed blog post about {topic}. Include citations and references."

    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # Adjust this based on your OpenAI model
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=1500
    )

    blog_post = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return blog_post

# Fetch trending topics and generate blog post
trending_topics = fetch_trending_topics()
for topic in trending_topics:
    blog_post = generate_blog_post(topic)
    print(f"Blog Post for {topic}:\n{blog_post}")

You can use Make (Integromat) to trigger this script periodically and automate the generation of blog posts for the trending topics.
Step 2: SEO Optimization & Linking

SEO can be optimized by adding internal/external links and tracking keyword clusters.

    Keyword Clustering: Use tools like Google Keyword Planner, Moz, or SEMrush APIs to track keyword clusters and optimize blog content accordingly.

    Example of adding internal links with Python:

import re

# Simple function to replace keywords with internal links
def add_internal_links(text, keyword_link_map):
    for keyword, link in keyword_link_map.items():
        text = re.sub(rf'\b{keyword}\b', f'<a href="{link}">{keyword}</a>', text)
    return text

# Example keyword-to-link mapping (usually this would be dynamic)
keyword_link_map = {
    "AI in Healthcare": "https://yourwebsite.com/ai-in-healthcare",
    "Quantum Computing": "https://yourwebsite.com/quantum-computing"
}

# Sample blog post
sample_blog_post = "AI in Healthcare is revolutionizing the way we treat patients. Quantum Computing can make healthcare more efficient."

# Add internal links
optimized_blog_post = add_internal_links(sample_blog_post, keyword_link_map)
print(optimized_blog_post)

You can also integrate services like Moz or SEMrush to fetch keyword data and suggest SEO improvements.
Step 3: Publishing to WordPress

For publishing to WordPress, you can use the WordPress REST API or the built-in Make (Integromat) WordPress Integration to publish content.

Python Example to Publish to WordPress API:

import requests

# WordPress API credentials
wp_url = 'https://yourwebsite.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts'
wp_username = 'your-username'
wp_password = 'your-password'  # Ideally use an Application Password for security

# Example function to publish a blog post to WordPress
def publish_to_wordpress(title, content):
    headers = {
        'Authorization': 'Basic ' + base64.b64encode(f"{wp_username}:{wp_password}".encode()).decode("utf-8"),
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    }
    
    post_data = {
        'title': title,
        'content': content,
        'status': 'publish',  # Automatically publish
    }
    
    response = requests.post(wp_url, headers=headers, json=post_data)
    if response.status_code == 201:
        print(f"Successfully published: {title}")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to publish post: {response.content}")

# Call the function to publish a post
title = "AI in Healthcare - The Future"
content = "Detailed content generated from the AI model..."
publish_to_wordpress(title, content)

In Make/Integromat, you can simply use the WordPress module to create and publish posts automatically.
Step 4: Image Selection & Optimization

For image selection, you can use the Unsplash API to fetch high-quality images related to the blog content.

import requests

# Example function to fetch an image from Unsplash API based on search term
def fetch_image_for_blog(topic):
    api_url = f'https://api.unsplash.com/photos/random?query={topic}&client_id=your-unsplash-api-key'
    response = requests.get(api_url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        image_data = response.json()[0]
        image_url = image_data['urls']['regular']
        return image_url
    else:
        return None

# Example usage to fetch an image for a blog on AI
image_url = fetch_image_for_blog("AI in Healthcare")
if image_url:
    print(f"Image URL for blog: {image_url}")
else:
    print("No image found")

In Make (Integromat), you can integrate this with the Unsplash API module to automatically fetch images and optimize them for the blog post.
Step 5: Automating the Entire Workflow in Make

Now, using Make (Integromat), you can automate the following sequence:

    Scheduled Trigger: Set up a daily schedule to fetch trending topics and trigger the Python script for content generation.
    SEO Optimization: Use Make (Integromat) to integrate SEO APIs (e.g., Moz or Ahrefs) and optimize blog content by adding internal/external links and keyword tracking.
    WordPress Integration: Use the WordPress module to publish the post automatically.
    Image Selection & Optimization: Integrate Unsplash API in Make (Integromat) to fetch and optimize images.

Conclusion

This solution involves using Make (Integromat) to automate the workflow, integrating APIs (like OpenAI for content generation, Moz/SEMrush for SEO, Unsplash for images), and using Python for specific tasks (like blog post generation and linking). Make (Integromat) will connect all the steps and automate everything from research to publishing.
